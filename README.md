EMPLOYER SIDE

On the home page for employers there is a message the first time you login that states you should create a listing.  Once you have created a listing this message will disappear.

Once you have created a listing, the home page will reflect this change by updating the homepage with a box that list your listings.  If you click the job type will be redirected to the applicants page. This is where you will view potential candidates who are looking for a job type that you made a listing for.  This list contains every candidate who has chosen the job type that matches your listing job type.
